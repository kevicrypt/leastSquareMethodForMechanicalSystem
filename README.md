# leastSquareMethodForMechanicalSystem
This C++ file computes the gear ratio, moment of inertia, and friction factor for a motor and gearbox system. The accompanying CSV file contains processed data from an actual motor-gearbox setup. The system is simulated using state-space equations, and I applied the least squares method to resolve the issue.
